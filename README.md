## üíª Getting started

### Requirements

- Have this application's [API](https://github.com/MohamedAmgd/Game-Deals-API) running

**Clone the project and access the folder**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MohamedAmgd/Game-Deals.git && cd Game-Deals
```

**Configre API**

- Add the API url in DEALS_API_URL in [This file](app/src/main/java/com/mohamed_amgd/gamedeals/GameDealsAppModule.kt)

### Working with Android Studio.

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is currently the official Android IDE. Due to this, it is recommended as the IDE to use in your development environment.

It is recommended to use the last version available in the stable channel of Android Studio updates. See what update channel is your Android Studio checking for updates in the menu path 'Help'/'Check for Update...'/link 'Updates' in the dialog.

To set up the project in Android Studio follow the next steps:

- Open Android Studio and select 'Import Project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc)'. Browse through your file system to the folder 'android' where the project is located. Android Studio will then create the '.iml' files it needs. If you ever close the project but the files are still there, you just select 'Open Project...'. The file chooser will show an Android face as the folder icon, which you can select to reopen the project.
- Android Studio will try to build the project directly after importing it. To build it manually, follow the menu path 'Build'/'Make Project', or just click the 'Play' button in the tool bar to build and run it in a mobile device or an emulator. The resulting APK file will be saved in the 'build/outputs/apk/' subdirectory in the project folder.

### Working in a terminal with Gradle:

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is the build system used by Android Studio to manage the building operations on Android apps. You do not need to install Gradle in your system, and Google recommends not to do it, but instead trusting on the [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) included in the project.

- Open a terminal and go to the 'android' directory that contains the repository.
- Run the 'clean' and 'build' tasks using the Gradle wrapper provided
  - Windows: `gradlew.bat clean build`
  - Mac OS/Linux: `./gradlew clean build`

The first time the Gradle wrapper is called, the correct Gradle version will be downloaded automatically. An Internet connection is needed for it works.
The generated APK file is saved in android/build/outputs/apk as android-debug.apk
